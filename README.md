# Game-of-Life
Simulated John Conway's Game of Life with python using pygame module and Object Oriented Programming

Rules of the game of life are:

For a space that is 'populated':
  Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.
  Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
  Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.
For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated':
  Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
